Parallel-Programming-Projects
=============================
Project to parallelized some algorithms and see how much speedup can it get, using C*, C++ OpenMP, and Java Multi Threading

Project 1 : Using C* to parallelized merging two sorted list algorithms
Project 2 : Using C* to parallelized prime number sieve algorithms
Project 3 : Using C* to parallelized red black relaxation
Project 4 : Using C++ OpenMP to parallelized Bucket Sort
Project 5 : Using Java Multi Threading to parallelized merging two sorted list algorithms
Project 6 : Using Java Multi Threading & Replicated Worker to parallelized shortest path algorithms
